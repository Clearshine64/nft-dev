              Crypto Camels Club (CCC) is a collection of 10,000 Crypto Camel NFTsâ€”unique digital collectibles living on the Ethereum blockchain. Your Crypto Camel doubles as your Club membership card, and grants access to members-only benefits, the first of which is access to THE MAJLIS, a collaborative message board. Future areas and perks can be unlocked by the community through roadmap activation.
